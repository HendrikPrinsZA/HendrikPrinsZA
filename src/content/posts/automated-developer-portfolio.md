This project was created out of frustration of having to maintain a WordPress site for longer than I ever should have. It will be a living project that will grow organically as features and optimisations are added.

## Current features

- [Astro](https://astro.build/) with [AstroPaper theme](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper)
- Automated REAMDE.md generated with GitHub Workflow with data fro [GitHub](https://github.com/), [WakaTime](https://wakatime.com/), [CodersRank](https://codersrank.io/), [Medium](https://medium.com/), and more.

## Expected features

- Add gallery of photos by integrating with [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)
- Generate blog posts from [Medium](https://medium.com/)
- Generate projects from [GitHub](https://github.com/)

## Getting started

1. Fork the [repo](https://github.com/HendrikPrinsZA/HendrikPrinsZA)

2. Configure the variables in `.env` file
